*Key Insights

A small number of artists contribute a large portion of total tracks
Popularity varies significantly across artists and song durations
Certain duration ranges are more common among high-popularity tracks
Visual storytelling helps identify patterns quickly

*Tools & Technologies

Power BI – Dashboard development and visualization
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Measures, calculated columns, and KPIs
Data Analysis & Data Visualization

*Project Objective
To demonstrate practical Power BI dashboarding, DAX usage, and data-driven insight generation using a real-world music streaming dataset.
